| Type of Matcha | Description               | Uses                      |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Ceremonial     | High-quality, smooth flavor. | Drinking, ceremonies.    |
| Premium        | Great for daily use.      | Lattes, smoothies.        |
| Culinary       | Stronger, slightly bitter. | Cooking, baking.          |
| Blended        | Mixed with other flavors. | Mixed beverages, lattes.  |

In my experience, using other matchas besides culinary matcha does not impart a strong enough flavor for the baked good to retain it's matcha flavor
